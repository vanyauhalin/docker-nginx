# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.1] - 2024-10-19

This is the first, initial release. It is probably stable, but I want to test it with my projects for a few months first. This is why it is under the patch version, not a minor one. When I am sure that it works well, I will increase the version to 0.1.0 and mark it as stable.

### Added

- A static Brotli module.
- The `ae` script for obtaining SSL certificates with their auto-renewal.
- The `ng` script for substituting environment variables in the Nginx configuration.
- A few basic snippets to configure Nginx.
